# Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) #

(DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the
"instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as are "C" and "G".

Write a function that takes one strand of the DNA and returns the complement side.

## Examples ##

* "ATTGC" -> "TAACG"
* "GTAT"  -> "CATA"
* ""      -> ""
